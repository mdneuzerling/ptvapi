\title{ptvapi: A package for accessing the Public Transport Victoria Timetable API}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{ptvapi.png}{options: align='right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Accessing the Public Transport Victoria Timetable API reqiures a user ID
(also called a \code{devid}) and an API key. These can be accessed by contacting
Public Transport Victoria. See
\url{https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/datasets/ptv-timetable-api/}

The user ID and API key can be entered directly into all functions.
Alternatively, all functions will pick up on the PTV_USER_ID and API_KEY
environment variables, if defined.

All API requests use SSL by default. To disable this, and to use the \code{http}
API endpoints rather than the \code{https} API endpoints, set the option:\preformatted{options(use_insecure_ptv_connection = TRUE)
}
}
\details{
This is an unofficial wrapper of the Public Transport Victoria Timetable API.
The author(s) of this package are unaffiliated with Public Transport
Victoria.
